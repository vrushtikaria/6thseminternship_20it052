Introduction:
Automated testing using Playwright is an effective way to ensure the quality of your .NET web applications. When combined with AWS services like CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and SES, you can create a powerful CI/CD pipeline that not only executes tests but also sends test reports via email using the Simple Email Service (SES). In this blog, we will guide you through the process of setting up the pipeline and integrating SES for email notifications.

Prerequisites:
Before you proceed, ensure you have the following:

1. Knowledge of Playwright and writing Playwright .NET tests.
2. An AWS account with sufficient permissions to create and manage AWS resources.
3. A verified email address in SES to send emails.

Step 1: Writing Playwright .NET Tests

Create your Playwright .NET test cases to cover the functionalities and user flows of your .NET web application. Ensure that your tests are reliable and can run without manual intervention.

Step 2: Setting up AWS CodeCommit

1. Create a CodeCommit Repository:
— Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CodeCommit service.
— Click on “Create repository” to create a new CodeCommit repository.
— Provide a name for your repository and any other desired configurations.

2. Push Your Code to CodeCommit:
— Use Git commands or any Git client to push your .NET web application’s code, including the Playwright .NET test cases, to the newly created CodeCommit repository.

Step 3: Setting up AWS CodeBuild

1. Create a CodeBuild Project:
— Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CodeBuild service.
— Click on “Create build project” to create a new CodeBuild project.
— Provide a name for your project and choose the CodeCommit repository you created in Step 2 as the source code location.

2. Configure Build Settings:
— In the build settings, choose the .NET runtime environment and specify the build commands required to restore dependencies and build your .NET application.

3. Save Test Results in HTML Format:
— Ensure that your Playwright .NET test runner generates test results in the HTML format during the build process.

Step 4: Setting up AWS CodePipeline

1. Create a CodePipeline:
— Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the CodePipeline service.
— Click on “Create pipeline” to create a new CodePipeline.
— Provide a name for your pipeline and select the source provider as CodeCommit.

2. Configure the Source Stage:
— Choose the CodeCommit repository and branch you want to use as the source for triggering the pipeline.

3. Add a CodeBuild Stage:
— Add a new stage to your pipeline and choose “AWS CodeBuild” as the action type.
— Select the CodeBuild project you created in Step 3 as the build action.

4. Configure the Test Stage:
— Add another stage to your pipeline for running the Playwright .NET tests.
— Configure the test stage to access the JUnit XML test results generated by CodeBuild.

5. Publish Test Results to S3 Bucket:
— Set up an S3 bucket to store the Playwright .NET test report files.
— In the test stage, configure CodeBuild to copy the JUnit XML test results to the S3 bucket.

Step 5: Set up AWS Lambda for SES Email Notifications

1. Create a Lambda Function:
— Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Lambda service.
— Click on “Create function” to create a new Lambda function.
— Choose “Author from scratch” and provide a name for your function.
— Select the .NET Core 3.1 runtime or any compatible runtime.

2. Set Up SES Permissions:
— In the “Execution role” section, choose an existing role with permissions to use SES or create a new role with the necessary SES permissions.

3. Write the Lambda Function Code:
— In the function code editor, write a .NET function to send an email using SES

4. Configure Lambda Triggers:
— To trigger the Lambda function after the Playwright .NET tests are executed and the test report is available in the S3 bucket, you can configure the Lambda function to be triggered by the S3 bucket event.

Step 6: Lambda IAM Role Permissions

Ensure that the Lambda function’s IAM role has the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket and SES for sending emails.

Step 7: Complete the CodePipeline Setup

1. Modify the Pipeline:
— Update the pipeline to add the Lambda function as a new action in the test stage.
— Configure the Lambda action to use the S3 bucket as the input source to access the Playwright .NET test report.

2. Test the Pipeline:
— Trigger the pipeline to verify that it executes the Playwright .NET tests, saves the test report to the S3 bucket, and triggers the Lambda function to send the email.

Step 8: Conclusion

With the setup now complete, your automated Playwright .NET tests will run seamlessly within the AWS CodePipeline. Once the tests are finished, the test report will be saved in an S3 bucket, and the Lambda function will send the test report via email using AWS SES. This comprehensive CI/CD
